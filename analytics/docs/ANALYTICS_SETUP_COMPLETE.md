Follow the guide in `GOOGLE_CLOUD_SETUP.md`:

1. Create Google Cloud Project
2. Enable BigQuery API and BigQuery ML API
3. Create service account with proper permissions
4. Download JSON credentials file
5. Save as `storage/google-credentials.json`

### **2. Configure Environment**

Add to your `.env` file:

```
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
```

### **3. Access Analytics Dashboard**

Once Google Cloud is set up, access:

- **Main Dashboard**: `/admin/analytics/dashboard`
- **Model Management**: `/admin/analytics/model-management`
- **Data Migration**: `/admin/analytics/data-migration`

## 📊 **Analytics Features Ready**
